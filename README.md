## Tools/Technologies

Azure Cloud, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, Flask, GitHub, 
Nginx, Docker, Docker Hub

## Libraries used 
NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn

## Activities 

- Collected images of various celebrities, performed data cleaning and generated 
wavelet transformed images.
- Created models for various Machine Learning (ML) algorithms like Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) classifier, Random Forest classifier and Logistic Regression.
- Trained the model using the actual and wavelet transformed images.
- Identified SVM as the best model after performing hyper parameter tuning with the 
help of Scikit-Learn GridSearchCV.
- Created and loaded the Pickle file as the model, added UI and executed the application 
in Python Flask.
- Used Nginx as web and reverse proxy server.
- Created Docker containers using Docker Compose and pushed them to Docker Hub.
- Deployed in Azure as an Azure web service from Docker Hub
